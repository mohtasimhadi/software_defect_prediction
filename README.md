# Software-Defect-Prediction
### Motivation
It can be useful to ensure software quality as it tries to predict defects of the modules of the software.

### Methadology

In this project some supervised machine learning techniques were used including **ANN**, **CNN**, **SVM**, **XGBoost**, **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest** to train a robust model to predict defects of the softwares. After fetching the results from the above techniques, we combine them through **Logistic Regression** and get the final output.

### Dataset

Open source datasets including *JM1*, *CM1*, *AR6*, *KC1*, *MC1*, *PC2* from NASA PROMISE Data Repository to perform this comparative study.

### Evaluation & Result

Widely used metrics for binary classification task were used such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC ROC. Result tables are included also.
